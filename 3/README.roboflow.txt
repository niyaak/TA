The dataset includes 1790 images.
Jalan-WaPc-EFGC-5fOi-3SAS are annotated in PNG Masks For Semantic Segmentation format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 448x256 (Fit (reflect edges))

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 12 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -7 and +7 degrees
* Random shear of between -10째 to +10째 horizontally and -10째 to +10째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.14 percent of pixels
